# Facial Expression Recognition CNN

Key learning elements:

» Run experiments in Google Colab and access files on Google Drive

» Build and evaluate a model using Tensorflow Eager mode

» Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize 7 facial expressions

For this exercise we are going to build a CNN for facial expression recognition on fer2013 dataset, available on Kaggle. fer2013 is a publicly accessible, and it contains 35,887 grayscale, 48 x 48 sized face images with 7 emotional expressions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral. 

We will build and train models on Google Colab, a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs on Google cloud and gives FREE GPU! 

Eager mode was introduced to the Tensorflow framework in TF 1.7. Unlike its predecessor, it allows imperative TF execution without building any graph, which is so convenient for building and evaluating neural networks using TF.
